# stacscheck starts by deleting class files and running this script.

# You MUST supply a copy of this script
# You are free to edit this build file but you MUST supply a version.  
# E.g. your might want to ... 
# 	include java files in subdirectories, or 
# 	or have additional command line options for java, or 
# 	might want to supply a makefile and make this command make, or 
# 	something else
# We expect this script to be runnable by stacscheck on lab machines
